# Shopping-List
I created a Shopping List App to learn HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS. The app lets users add and delete items in their list. Firebase integration provides real-time updates, giving hands-on experience in frontend and backend development. This project strengthened my skills and paved the way for more complex web applications.
